belief
take
hold
of
him
touching
this
dreaded
sight
twice
seen
of

have
entreated
him
along
with

to
watch
the
minutes
of
this
night

have
two
nights
seen
well
sit
we
down
and
let
us
hear
bernardo
speak
of
this
last
night
of
all
when
yond
same
star
thats
westward
from
the
pole
had
made
his
course
to
illume
that
part
of
heaven
where
now
it
burns
marcellus
and
myself

bell

beating

enter
ghost
peace
break
thee

comes
again
in
the
same
figure
like
the
king
thats
dead
thou
art
a
scholar
speak
to
it
horatio
looks
it
not
like
the
king
mark
it
horatio
most
like
it
harrows
me
with
fear
and
wonder
it
would
be
spoke
to
question
it
horatio
what
art
thou
that
usurpst
this
time
of
night
together
with
that
fair
and
warlike
form
in
which
the
majesty
of
buried
denmark
did
sometimes
march
by
heaven
charge
thee
speak
it
is
offended
see
it
stalks
away
stay
speak
speak
charge
thee
speak
exit
ghost
tis
gone
and
will
not
answer
how
now
horatio
you
tremble
and
look
pale
is
not
this
something
more
than
fantasy
what
think
you
ont
before
my
god
might
not
this
believe
without
the
sensible
and
true
avouch
of
mine
own
eyes
is
it
not
like
the
king
as
thou
art
to
thyself
such
was
the
very
armour
he
had
on
when
he
the
ambitious
norway
combated
so
frownd
he
once
when
in
an
angry
parle
he
smote
the
sledded
polacks
on
the
ice
tis
strange
thus
twice
before
and
jump
at
this
dead
hour
with
martial
stalk
hath
he
gone
by
our
watch
in
what
particular
thought
to
work
know
not
but
in
the
gross
and
scope
of
my
opinion
this
bodes
some
strange
eruption
to
our
state
good
now
sit
down
and
tell
me
he
that
knows
why
this
same
strict
and
most
observant
watch
so
nightly
toils
the
subject
of
the
land
and
why
such
daily
cast
of
brazen
cannon
and
foreign
mart
for
implements
of
war
why
such
impress
of
shipwrights
whose
sore
task
does
not
divide
the
sunday
from
the
week
what
might
be
toward
that
this
sweaty
haste
doth
make
the
night
jointlabourer
with
the
day
who
ist
that
can
inform
me
that
can
at
least
the
whisper
goes
so
our
last
king
whose
image
even
but
now
appeard
to
us
was
as
you
know
by
fortinbras
of
norway
thereto
prickd
on
by
a
most
emulate
pride
dared
to
the
combat
in
which
our
valiant
hamlet
for
so
this
side
of
our
known
world
esteemd
him
did
slay
this
fortinbras
who
by
a
seald
compact
well
ratified
by
law
and
heraldry
did
forfeit
with
his
life
all
those
his
lands
which
he
stood
seized
of
to
the
conqueror
against
the
which
a
moiety
competent
was
gaged
by
our
king
which
had
returnd
to
the
inheritance
of
fortinbras
had
he
been
vanquisher
as
by
the
same
covenant
and
carriage
of
the
article
designd
his
fell
to
hamlet
now
sir
young
fortinbras
of
unimproved
mettle
hot
and
full
hath
in
the
skirts
of
norway
here
and
there
sharkd
up
a
list
of
lawless
resolutes
for
food
and
diet
to
some
enterprise
that
hath
a
stomach
int
which
is
no
other
as
it
doth
well
appear
unto
our
state
but
to
recover
of
us
by
strong
hand
and
terms
compulsatory
those
foresaid
lands
so
by
his
father
lost
and
this
take
it
is
the
main
motive
of
our
preparations
the
source
of
this
our
watch
and
the
chief
head
of
this
posthaste
and
romage
in
the
land
think
it
be
no
other
but
een
so
well
may
it
sort
that
this
portentous
figure
comes
armed
through
our
watch
so
like
the
king
that
was
and
is
the
question
of
these
wars
mote
it
is
to
trouble
the
minds

the
most
high
and
palmy
state
of
rome
little
ere
the
mightiest
julius
fell
the
graves
stood
tenantless
and
the
sheeted
dead
did
squeak
and
gibber
in
the
roman
streets
as
stars
with
trains
of
fire
and
dews
of
blood

in
the

moist

almost
to
doomsday
with
eclipse
and
even
the
like
precurse

upon
a
fearful
summons
have
heard
the
cock
that
is
the
trumpet
to
the
morn
doth
with
his
lofty
and
shrillsounding
throat
awake

at
his
warning

of

the
crowing
of

that

that
season

wherein
our
saviours
birth
is
celebrated
the
bird
of

night

then
they

no

no

is
the

so
have
heard
and

in

believe
it
but
look
the
morn
in
russet
mantle
clad
walks
oer
the
dew
of
yon
high
eastward
hill
break
we
our
watch
up
and
by
my
advice
let
us
impart
what
we
have
seen
tonight
unto
young
hamlet
for
upon
my
life
this
spirit
dumb
to
us
will
speak
to
him
do
you
consent
we
shall
acquaint
him
with
it
as
needful
in
our
loves
fitting
our
duty
lets
dot
pray
and
this
morning
know
where
we
shall
find
him
most
conveniently
exeunt
room
of
state
in
the
castle
enter
lords
and
attendants
though
yet
of
hamlet
our
dear
brothers
death
the
memory
be
green
and
that
it
us
befitted
to
bear
our
hearts
in
grief
and
our
whole
kingdom
to
be
contracted
in
one
brow
of
woe
yet
so
far
hath
discretion
fought
with
nature
that
we
with
wisest
sorrow
think
on
him
together
with
remembrance
of
ourselves
therefore
our
sometime
sister
now
our
queen
the
imperial
jointress
to
this
warlike
state
have
we
as
twere
with
a
defeated
joy
with
an
auspicious
and
a
dropping
eye
with
mirth
in
funeral
and
with
dirge
in
marriage
in
equal
scale
weighing
delight
and
dole
taken
to
wife
nor
have
we
herein
barrd
your
better
wisdoms
which
have
freely
gone
with
this
affair
along
for
all
our
thanks
now
follows
that
you
know
young
fortinbras
holding
a
weak
supposal
of
our
worth
or
thinking
by
our
late
dear
brothers
death
our
state
to
be
disjoint
and
out
of
frame
colleagued
with
the
dream
of
his
advantage
he
hath
not
faild
to
pester
us
with
message
importing
the
surrender
of
those
lands
lost
by
his
father
with
all
bonds
of
law
to
our
most
valiant
brother
so
much
for
him
now
for
ourself
and
for
this
time
of
meeting
thus
much
the
business
is
we
have
here
writ
to
norway
uncle
of
young
fortinbras
who
impotent
and
bedrid
scarcely
hears
of
this
his
nephews
purposeto
suppress
his
further
gait
herein
in
that
the
levies
the
lists
and
full
proportions
are
all
made
out
of
his
subject
and
we
here
dispatch
you
good
cornelius
and
you
voltimand
for
bearers
of
this
greeting
to
old
norway
giving
to
you
no
further
personal
power
to
business
with
the
king
more
than
the
scope
of
these
delated
articles
allow
farewell
and
let
your
haste
commend
your
duty
in
that
and
all
things
will
we
show
our
duty

wouldst
thou
beg
laertes
that
shall
not
be
my
offer
not
thy
asking
the
head
is
not
more
native
to
the
heart
the
hand
more
instrumental
to
the
mouth
than
is
the
throne
of
denmark
to
thy
father
what
wouldst
thou
have
laertes
my
dread
lord
your
leave
and
favour
to
return
to
france

whence
though
willingly
came
to
denmark
to
show
my
duty
in
your
coronation
yet
now
must
confess
that
duty
done
my
thoughts
and
wishes
bend
again
toward
france
and
bow
them
to
your
gracious
leave
and
pardon
have
you
your
fathers
leave
what
says
polonius
he
hath
my
lord
wrung
from
me
my
slow
leave
by
laboursome
petition
and
at
last
upon
his
will
seald
my
hard
consent
do
beseech

cast
thy
nighted
colour
off
and
let
thine
eye
look
like
a
friend
on
denmark
do
not
for
ever
with
thy
vailed
lids
seek
for
thy

give
these
mourning
duties
to
your
father

you
must
know
your

lost
a
father
that
father
lost
lost
his
and
the
survivor
bound
in
filial
obligation
for
some
term
to
do
obsequious
sorrow
but
to
persever
in
obstinate
condolement
is
a
course
of
impious
stubbornness
tis
unmanly
grief
it
shows
a
will
most
incorrect
to
heaven
heart
unfortified
a
mind
impatient
an
understanding
simple
and
unschoold
for
what
we
know
must
be
and
is
as
common
as
any
the
most
vulgar
thing
to
sense
why
should
we
in
our
peevish
opposition
take
it
to
heart
fie
tis
a
fault
to
heaven
fault
against
the
dead
a
fault
to
nature
to
reason
most
absurd
whose
common
theme
is
death
of
fathers
and
who
still
hath
cried
from
the
first
corse
till
he
that
died
today
this
must
be
so
we
pray
you
throw
to
earth
this
unprevailing
woe
and
think
of
us
as
of
a
father
for
let
the
world
take
note
you
are
the
most
immediate
to
our
throne
and
with
no
less
nobility
of
love
than
that
which
dearest
father
bears
his
son
do
impart
toward
you
for
your
intent
in
going
back
to
school
in
wittenberg
it
is
most
retrograde
to
our
desire

we
beseech
you
bend
you
to
remain
here
in
the
cheer
and
comfort
of
our

this
marvel
to
you
for

let
me
hear
two
nights
together
had
these
gentlemen
marcellus
and
bernardo
on
their
watch
in
the
dead
vast
and
middle
of
the
night
been
thus
encounterd
figure
like
your
father
armed
at
point
exactly
capape
appears
before
them
and
with
solemn
march
goes
slow
and
stately
by
them
thrice
he
walkd
by
their
oppressd
and
fearsurprised
eyes
within
his
truncheons
length
whilst
they
distilled
almost
to
jelly
with
the
act
of
fear
stand
dumb
and
speak
not
to
him
this
to
me
in
dreadful
secrecy
impart
they
did
and
with
them
the
third
night
kept
the
watch
where
as
they
had
deliverd
both
in
time
form
of
the
thing
each
word
made
true
and
good
the
apparition
comes
knew
your
father
these
hands
are
not
more
like
but
where
was
this
my
lord
upon
the
platform
where
we
watchd
did
you
not
speak
to
it
my
lord
did
but
answer
made
it
none
yet
once
methought
it
lifted
up
its
head
and
did
address
itself
to
motion
like
as
it
would
speak
but
even
then
the
morning
cock
crew
loud
and
at
the
sound
it
shrunk
in
haste
away
and
vanishd
from
our
sight
tis
very
strange
as
do
live
my
honourd
lord
tis
true
and
we
did
think
it
writ
down
in
our
duty
to
let
you
know
of
it
indeed
indeed
sirs
but
this
troubles
me
hold
you
the
watch
tonight
we
do
my
lord
armd
say
you
armd
my
lord
from
top
to
toe
my
lord
from
head
to
foot
then
saw
you
not
his
face
yes
my
lord
he
wore
his
beaver
up
what
lookd
he
frowningly
countenance
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
pale
or
red
nay
very
pale
and
fixd
his
eyes
upon
you
most
constantly
would
had
been
there
it
would
have
much
amazed
you
very
like
very
like
stayd
it
long
while
one
with
moderate
haste
might
tell
a
hundred
longer
longer
not
when
sawt
his
beard
was
grizzledno
it
was
as
have
seen
it
in
his
life
sable
silverd
will
watch
tonight
perchance
twill
walk
again
warrant
it
will
if
it
assume
my
noble
fathers
person
ill
speak
to
it
though
hell
itself
should
gape
and
bid
me
hold
my
peace
pray
you
all
if
you
have
hitherto
conceald
this
sight
let
it
be
tenable
in
your
silence
still
and
whatsoever
else
shall
hap
tonight
give
it
an
understanding
but
no
tongue
will
requite
your
loves
so
fare
you
well
upon
the
platform
twixt
eleven
and
twelve
ill
visit
you
all
our
duty
to
your
honour
your
loves
as
mine
to
you
farewell
exeunt
all
but
my
fathers
spirit
in
arms
all
is
not
well
doubt
some
foul
play
would
the
night
were
come
till
then
sit
still
my
soul
foul
deeds
will
rise
though
all
the
earth
oerwhelm
them
to
mens
eyes
exit
room
in
polonius
house
enter
and
my
necessaries
are
embarkd
farewell
and
sister
as
the
winds
give
benefit
and
convoy
is
assistant
do
not
sleep
but
let
me
hear
from
you
do
you
doubt
that
for
hamlet
and
the
trifling
of
his
favour
hold
it
a
fashion
and
a
toy
in
blood
violet
in
the
youth
of
primy
nature
forward
not
permanent
sweet
not
lasting
the
perfume
and
suppliance
of
a
minute
no
more
no
more
but
so
think
it
no
more
for
nature
crescent
does
not
grow
alone
in
thews
and
bulk
but
as
this
temple
waxes
the
inward
service
of
the
mind
and
soul
grows
wide
withal
perhaps
he
loves
you
now
and
now
no
soil
nor
cautel
doth
besmirch
the
virtue
of
his
will
but
you
must
fear
his
greatness
weighd
his
will
is
not
his
own
for
he
himself
is
subject
to
his
birth
he
may
not
as
unvalued
persons
do
carve
for
himself
for
on
his
choice
depends
the
safety
and
health
of
this
whole
state
and
therefore
must
his
choice
be
circumscribed
unto
the
voice
and
yielding
of
that
body
whereof
he
is
the
head
then
if
he
says
he
loves
you
it
fits
your
wisdom
so
far
to
believe
it
as
he
in
his
particular
act
and
place
may
give
his
saying
deed
which
is
no
further
than
the
main
voice
of
denmark
goes
withal
then
weigh
what
loss
your
honour
may
sustain
if
with
too
credent
ear
you
list
his
songs
or
lose
your
heart
or
your
chaste
treasure
open
to
his
unmasterd
importunity
fear
it
ophelia
fear
it
my
dear
sister
and
keep
you
in
the
rear
of
your
affection
out
of
the
shot
and
danger
of
desire
the
chariest
maid
is
prodigal
enough
if
she
unmask
her
beauty
to
the
moon
virtue
itself
scapes
not
calumnious
strokes
the
canker
galls
the
infants
of
the
spring
too
oft
before
their
buttons
be
disclosed
and
in
the
morn
and
liquid
dew
of
youth
contagious
blastments
are
most
imminent
be
wary
then
best
safety
lies
in
fear
youth
to
itself
rebels
though
none
else
near
shall
the
effect
of
this
good
lesson
keep
as
watchman
to
my
heart
but
good
my
brother
do
not
as
some
ungracious
pastors
do
show
me
the
steep
and
thorny
way
to
heaven
whiles
like
a
puffd
and
reckless
libertine
himself
the
primrose
path
of
dalliance
treads
and
recks
not

me
not

shame
the

in
the

you
are

for
there
my
blessing
with
thee
and
these
few
precepts
in
thy
memory
see
thou
character
give
thy
thoughts
no
tongue
nor
any
unproportioned

by
no

those
friends
thou
hast
and
their
adoption
tried
grapple
them
to
thy
soul
with

of
steel
but
do
not
dull
thy
palm
with
entertainment
of
each
newhatchd
unfledged
comrade
beware
of
entrance
to
a
quarrel
but
being
in
beart
that
the
opposed
may
beware
of
thee
give
every
man
thy
ear
but
few
thy
voice
take
each
mans
censure
but
reserve
thy
judgment
costly
thy
habit
as
thy
purse
can
buy
but
not
expressd
in

rich
not
gaudy
for
the
apparel

they
in
france
of
the
best
rank

station
are
of
a
most
select

generous
chief
in

neither

a
lender
be
for
loan
oft
loses
both
itself

borrowing
dulls
the
edge
of
husbandry
this
above
all
to
thine
ownself

true

it
must
follow

oft
of
late
given
private
time
to
you
and
you
yourself
have
of
your
audience
been
most
free
and
bounteous
if
it

so
as
so
tis
put
on
me
and
that
in
way
of
caution

tell
you
you
do
not
understand
yourself
so
clearly
as
it
behoves
my
daughter
and
your
honour
what
is
between
you
give
me
up
the
truth
he
hath
my
lord
of
late
made
many
tenders
of
his
affection
to
me
affection
pooh
you
speak
like
a
green
girl
unsifted
in
such
perilous
circumstance
do
you
believe
his
tenders
as
you
call
them
do
not
know
my
lord
what
should
think
marry
ill
teach
you
think
yourself
a
baby
that
you
have
taen
these
tenders
for
true
pay
which
are
not
sterling
tender
yourself
more
dearly
ornot
to
crack
the
wind
of
the
poor
phrase
running
it
thusyoull
tender
me
a
fool
my
lord
he
hath
importuned
me
with
love
in
honourable
fashion
ay
fashion
you
may
call
it
go
to
go
to
and
hath
given
countenance
to
his
speech
my
lord
with
almost
all
the
holy
vows
of
heaven
ay
springes
to
catch
woodcocks
do
know
when
the
blood
burns
how
prodigal
the
soul
lends
the
tongue
vows
these
blazes
daughter
giving
more
light
than
heat
extinct
in
both
even
in
their
promise
as
it
is
amaking
you
must
not
take
for
fire
from
this
time
be
somewhat
scanter
of
your
maiden
presence
set
your
entreatments
at
a
higher
rate
than
a
command
to
parley
for
lord
hamlet
believe
so
much
in
him
that
he
is
young
and
with
a
larger
tether
may
he
walk
than
may
be
given
you
in
few
ophelia
do
not
believe
his
vows
for
they
are
brokers
not
of
that
dye
which
their
investments
show
but
mere
implorators
of
unholy
suits
breathing
like
sanctified
and
pious
bawds
the
better
to
beguile
this
is
for
all
would
not
in
plain
terms
from
this
time
forth
have
you
so
slander
any

leisure
as

my

exeunt
the

the

it

it

a

an
eager
air
what
hour
now

it
lacks
of
twelve
no
it
is
struck
indeed
heard
it
not
then
it
draws
near
the
season
wherein
the
spirit
held
his
wont
to
walk
flourish
of
trumpets
and
ordnance
shot
off
within
what

this

my

his

as

drains
his
draughts

thus
bray
out
the
triumph
of
his

to
my
mind
though
am
native
here
and
to
the
manner
born
it
is
a
custom
more
honourd

the

this

thy

freeze
thy

make
thy
two

start
from
their

thy
knotted

hair

haste
me

that
with

as
swift
as

my

thee
apt

duller
shouldst
thou

roots
itself
in

that
sleeping
in
my
orchard
serpent
stung
me
so
the
whole
ear
of
denmark
is
by
a
forged
process
of
my
death
rankly
abused
but
know
thou
noble
youth
the
serpent
that
did
sting
thy
fathers
life
now
wears
his
crown
my
prophetic
soul
my
uncle

that
incestuous
that
adulterate
beast
with
witchcraft
of
his
wit
with
traitorous
gifts
wicked
wit
and
gifts
that
have
the
power
so
to
seducewon
to
his
shameful
lust
the
will
of
my
most
seemingvirtuous
queen
hamlet
what
a
fallingoff
was
there
from
me
whose
love
was
of
that
dignity
that
it
went
hand
in
hand
even
with
the
vow
made
to
her
in
marriage
and
to
decline
upon
a
wretch
whose
natural
gifts
were
poor
to
those
of
mine
but
virtue
as
it
never
will
be
moved
though
lewdness
court
it
in
a
shape

a
radiant
angel
linkd

sate
itself
in
a
celestial
bed

prey
on
garbage

me
be
sleeping
within
my
orchard
my
custom
always
of
the
afternoon
upon
my
secure
hour
thy
uncle
stole
with
juice
of
cursed
hebenon
in
a
vial
and
in
the
porches
of
my
ears
did
pour
the
leperous
distilment
whose
effect
holds
such
an
enmity
with
blood
of
man
that
swift
as
quicksilver
it
courses
through
the
natural
gates
and
alleys
of
the
body

with
a
sudden
vigour
doth
posset

like
eager

thin

it
mine

a
most

tetter
barkd
about
most
lazarlike
with
vile
and
loathsome
crust
all
my
smooth
body
thus

sleeping
by
a

life
of
crown

of
his
behavior
my

did
intend

marry
well
said
very
well
said
look
you
sir
inquire
me
first
what
danskers
are
in
paris
and
how
and
who
what
means
and
where
they
keep
what
company
at
what
expense
and
finding
by
this
encompassment
and
drift
of
question
that
they
do
know
my
son
come
you
more
nearer
than
your
particular
demands
will
touch
it
take
you
as
twere
some
distant
knowledge
of
him
as
thus
know
his
father
and
his
friends
and
in
part
him
do
you
mark
this
reynaldo
ay
very
well
my
lord
and
in
part
him
but
you
may
say
not
well
but
ift
be
he
mean
hes
very
wild
addicted
so
and
so
and
there
put
on
him
what
forgeries
you
please
marry
none
so
rank
as
may
dishonour
him
take
heed
of
that
but
sir
such
wanton
wild
and
usual
slips
as
are
companions
noted
and
most
known
to
youth
and
liberty
as
gaming
my
lord
ay
or
drinking
fencing
swearing
quarrelling
drabbing
you
may
go
so
far
my
lord
that
would
dishonour
him
faith
no
as
you
may
season
it
in
the
charge
you
must
not
put
another
scandal
on
him
that
he
is
open
to
incontinency
thats
not
my
meaning
but
breathe
his
faults
so
quaintly
that
they
may
seem
the
taints
of
liberty
the
flash
and
outbreak
of
a
fiery
mind
savageness
in
unreclaimed
blood
of
general
assault
but
my
good
lord
wherefore
should
you
do
this
ay
my
lord
would
know
that
marry
sir
heres
my
drift
and
believe
it
is
a
fetch
of

laying
these
slight
sullies
on
my
son
as

my

and
then
sir
does

videlicet
a
brothel
or
so
forth
see
you
now
your
bait
of
falsehood
takes
this
carp
of
truth
and
thus
do
we
of
wisdom
and
of
reach
with
windlasses
and
with
assays
of
bias
by
indirections

my

observe
his
inclination
in
yourself

and
let
him
ply
his
music
well
my
lord
farewell
exit
enter
how
now
ophelia
whats
the
matter
my
lord
my
lord
have
been
so
affrighted
with
what
i
the
name
of
god
my
lord
as
was
sewing
in
my
closet
lord
hamlet
with
his
doublet
all
unbraced
no
hat
upon
his
head
his
stockings
fould
ungarterd
and
downgyved
to
his
ancle
pale
as
his
shirt
his
knees
knocking
each
other
and
with
a
look
so
piteous
in
purport
as
if
he
had
been
loosed
out
of
hell
to
speak
of
horrorshe
comes
before
me
mad
for
thy
love
my
lord
do
not
know
but
truly
do
fear
it
what
said
he
he
took
me
by
the
wrist
and
held
me
hard
then
goes
he
to
the
length
of
all
his
arm
and
with
his
other
hand
thus
oer
his
brow
he
falls
to
such
perusal
of
my
face
as
he
would
draw
it
long
stayd
he
so
at
last
a
little
shaking
of
mine
arm
and
thrice
his
head
thus
waving
up
and
down
he
raised
a
sigh
so
piteous
and
profound
as
it
did
seem
to
shatter
all
his
bulk
and
end
his
being
that
done
he
lets
me
go
and
with
his
head
over
his
shoulder
turnd
he
seemd
to
find
his
way
without
his
eyes
for
out
o
doors
he
went
without
their
helps
and
to
the
last
bended
their
light
on
me
come
go
with
me
will
go
seek
the
king
this
is
the
very
ecstasy
of
love
whose
violent
property
fordoes
itself
and
leads
the
will
to
desperate
undertakings
as
oft
as
any
passion
under
heaven
that
does
afflict
our
natures
am
sorry
what
have
you
given
him
any
hard
words
of
late
no
my
good
lord
but
as
you
did
command
did
repel
his
fetters
and
denied
his
access
to
me
that
hath
made
him
mad
am
sorry
that
with
better
heed
and
judgment
had
not
quoted
him
feard
he
did
but
trifle
and
meant
to
wreck
thee
but
beshrew
my
jealousy
by
heaven
it
is
as
proper
to
our
age
to
cast
beyond
ourselves
in
our
opinions
as
it
is
common
for
the
younger
sort
to
lack
discretion
come
go
we
to
the
king
this
must
be
known
which
being
kept
close
might
move
more
grief
to
hide
than
hate
to
utter
love
exeunt

in
the
castle
enter
and

welcome
dear
rosencrantz

moreover
that
we
much
did
long
to
see
you
the
need
we
have
to
use
you
did
provoke
our
hasty
sending
something
have
you
heard
of
hamlets
transformation
so
call
it
sith
nor
the
exterior
nor
the
inward
man
resembles
that
it
was
what
it
should
be
more
than
his
fathers
death
that
thus
hath
put
him
so
much
from
the
understanding
of
himself
cannot
dream
of
entreat
you
both
that
being
of
so
young
days
brought
up
with
him
and
sith
so

to
his
youth
and

that
you
vouchsafe
your
rest
here
in
our
court
some
little
time
so
by
your
companies
to
draw
him
on
to
pleasures
and
to
gather
so
much
as
from
occasion
you
may
glean
whether
aught
to
us
unknown
afflicts
him
thus
that
opend
lies
within

so
much
gentry

your
time
with
us
awhile
for
the
supply

of
our
hope
your
visitation
shall
receive
such

your
majesties

by
the
sovereign
power
you
have
of
us
put
your
dread
pleasures
more
into
command
than
to
entreaty
but
we
both
obey
and
here
give
up
ourselves
in
the
full
bent

how

what
do
you
think
of
me
as
of
a
man
faithful

honourable
would
fain
prove
so

what
might
you
think
when
had
seen
this
hot
love
on
the
wing

a
winking
mute
and

or
lookd
upon
this
love
with
idle
sight
what
might

think
no
went
round
to
work
and
my
young
mistress
thus
did
bespeak
lord
hamlet
is
a
prince
out
of
thy
star
this
must
not
be
and
then
precepts
gave
her
that
she
should
lock
herself
from
his
resort
admit
no
messengers
receive
no
tokens
which
done
she
took
the
fruits
of
my
advice
and
he
repulseda
short
tale
to
make
fell
into
a
sadness
then
into
a
fast
thence
to
a
watch
thence
into
a
weakness
thence
to
a
lightness
and
by
this
declension
into
the
madness
wherein
now
he
raves
and
all
we
mourn
for
do
you
think
tis
this
it
may
be
very
likely
hath
there
been
such
a

so
when

take
this
from
this
if
this
be
otherwise
if
circumstances
lead
me
will
find
where
truth
is
hid
though
it
were
hid
indeed
within
the
centre
how
may
we
try
it
further
you
know
sometimes
he
walks
four
hours
together
here
in
the
lobby
so
he
does
indeed
at
such
a
time
ill
loose
my
daughter
to
him
be
you
and
behind
an
arras
then
mark
the
encounter
if
he
love
her
not
and
be
not
from
his
reason
falln
thereon
let
me
be
no
assistant
for
a
state
but
keep
a
farm
and
carters
we
will
try
it
but
look
where
sadly
the
poor
wretch
comes
reading
away
do
beseech
you
both
away
ill
board
him
presently
exeunt

how

you
by
that
still

far
gone
far
gone
and
truly
in
my
youth
suffered
much
extremity

grey
beards
that
their
faces
are
wrinkled
their
eyes
purging
thick
amber
and
plumtree
gum
and
that
they
have
a
plentiful
lack
of
wit
together
with
most
weak
hams
all
which
sir
though
most
powerfully
and
potently
believe
yet
hold
it
not
honesty
to
have
it
thus
set
down
for
yourself
sir
should
be
old
as
am
if
like
a
crab
you
could
go
backward
aside
though
this
be
madness
yet
there
is
method
in

will
you
walk
out
of
the

my
lord
into
my
grave
indeed
that

out
o
the
air
aside
how
pregnant
sometimes
his
replies
are
a
happiness
that
often
madness
hits
on
which
reason
and
sanity
could
not
so
prosperously
be
delivered
of

leave
him
and

contrive
the

of
meeting
between
him

honourable
lord
will
most
humbly
take
my
leave

you

take
from
me
any

that

more
willingly
part
withal

my
honoured

my
most
dear
lord
my
excellent
good
friends
how
dost
thou
guildenstern
ah
rosencrantz
good
lads
how
do
ye
both
as
the
indifferent
children
of
the
earth
happy
in
that
we
are
not
overhappy
on
fortunes
cap
we
are
not
the
very
button
nor
the
soles
of
her
shoe
neither
my
lord
then
you
live
about
her
waist
or
in
the
middle
of
her
favours
faith
her
privates
we
in
the
secret
parts
of
fortune
most
true
she
is
a
strumpet
whats
the
news
none
my
lord
but
that
the
worlds
grown
honest
then
is
doomsday
near
but
your
news
is
not
true
let
me
question
more
in
particular
what
have
you
my
good
friends
deserved
at
the
hands
of
fortune
that
she
sends
you
to
prison
hither
prison
my
lord
denmarks
a
prison
then
is
the
world
one
goodly
one
in
which
there
are
many
confines
wards
and
dungeons
denmark
being
one
o
the
worst
we
think
not
so
my
lord
why
then
tis
none
to
you
for
there
is
nothing
either
good
or
bad
but
thinking
makes
it
so
to
me
it
is
a
prison
why
then
your
ambition
makes
it
one
tis
too
narrow
for
your
mind
god
could
be
bounded
in
a
nut
shell
and
count
myself
a
king
of
infinite
space
were
it
not
that
have
bad
dreams
which
dreams
indeed
are
ambition
for
the
very
substance
of
the
ambitious
is
merely
the
shadow
of
a
dream
dream
itself
is
but
a
shadow
truly
and
hold
ambition
of
so
airy
and
light
a
quality
that
it
is
but
a
shadows
shadow
then
are
our
beggars
bodies
and
our
monarchs
and
outstretched
heroes
the
beggars
shadows
shall
we
to
the
court
for
by
my
fay
cannot
reason
well
wait
upon
you
no
such
matter
will
not
sort
you
with
the
rest
of
my
servants
for
to
speak
to
you
like
an
honest
man
am
most
dreadfully
attended
but
in
the
beaten
way
of
friendship
what
make
you
at
elsinore
to
visit
you
my
lord
no
other
occasion
beggar
that
am
am
even
poor
in
thanks
but
thank
you
and
sure
dear
friends
my
thanks
are
too
dear
a
halfpenny
were
you
not
sent
for
is
it
your
own
inclining
is
it
a
free
visitation
come
deal
justly
with
me
come
come
nay
speak
what
should
we
say
my
lord
why
any
thing
but
to
the
purpose
you
were
sent
for
and
there
is
a
kind
of
confession
in
your
looks
which
your
modesties
have
not
craft
enough
to
colour
know
the
good
king
and
queen
have
sent
for
you
to
what
end
my
lord
that
you
must
teach
me
but
let
me
conjure
you
by
the
rights
of
our
fellowship
by
the
consonancy
of
our
youth
by
the
obligation
of
our
everpreserved
love
and
by
what
more
dear
a
better
proposer
could
charge
you
withal
be
even
and
direct
with
me
whether
you
were
sent
for
or
no
aside
to
what
say
you
aside
nay
then
have
an
eye
of
youif
you
love
me
hold
not
off
my
lord
we
were
sent
for
will
tell
you
why
so
shall
my
anticipation
prevent
your
discovery
and
your
secrecy
to
the
king
and
queen
moult
no
feather
have
of
latebut
wherefore
know
notlost
all
my
mirth
forgone
all
custom
of
exercises
and
indeed
it
goes
so
heavily
with
my
disposition
that
this
goodly
frame
the
earth
seems
to
me
a
sterile
promontory
this
most
excellent
canopy
the
air
look
you
this
brave
oerhanging
firmament
this
majestical
roof
fretted
with
golden
fire
why
it
appears
no
other
thing
to
me
than
a
foul
and
pestilent
congregation
of
vapours
what
a
piece
of
work
is
a
man
how
noble
in
reason
how
infinite
in
faculty
in
form
and
moving
how
express
and
admirable
in
action
how
like
an
angel
in
apprehension
how
like
a
god
the
beauty
of
the
world
the
paragon
of
animals
and
yet
to
me
what
is
this
quintessence
of
dust
man
delights
not
me
no
nor
woman
neither
though
by
your
smiling
you
seem
to
say
so
my
lord
there
was
no
such
stuff
in
my
thoughts
why
did
you
laugh
then
when
said
man
delights
not
me
to
think
my
lord
if
you
delight
not
in
man
what
lenten
entertainment
the
players
shall
receive
from
you
we
coted
them
on
the
way
and
hither
are
they
coming
to
offer
you
service
he
that
plays
the
king
shall
be
welcome
his
majesty
shall
have
tribute
of
me
the
adventurous
knight
shall
use
his
foil
and
target
the
lover
shall
not
sigh
gratis
the
humourous
man
shall
end
his
part
in
peace
the
clown
shall
make
those
laugh
whose
lungs
are
tickled
o
the
sere
and
the
lady
shall
say
her
mind
freely
or
the
blank
verse
shall
halt
fort
what
players
are
they
even
those
you
were
wont
to
take
delight
in
the
tragedians
of
the
city
how
chances
it
they
travel
their
residence
both
in
reputation
and
profit
was
better
both
ways
think
their
inhibition
comes
by
the
means
of
the
late
innovation
do
they
hold
the
same
estimation
they
did
when
was
in
the
city
are
they
so
followed
no
indeed
are
they
not
how
comes
it
do
they
grow
rusty
nay
their
endeavour
keeps
in
the
wonted
pace
but
there
is
sir
an
aery
of
children
little
eyases
that
cry
out
on
the
top
of
question
and
are
most

get
from
him
why
he
puts
on
this
confusion
grating
so
harshly
all
his
days
of
quiet
with
turbulent
and
dangerous
lunacy
he
does
confess
he
feels
himself
distracted
but
from
what
cause
he
will
by
no
means
speak
nor
do
we
find
him
forward
to
be
sounded
but
with
a
crafty
madness
keeps
aloof
when
we
would
bring
him
on
to
some
confession
of
his
true
state
did
he
receive
you
well
most
like
a
gentleman
but
with
much
forcing
of
his
disposition
niggard
of
question
but
of
our
demands
most
free
in
his
reply
did
you
assay
him
to
any
pastime
madam
it
so
fell
out
that
certain
players
we
oerraught
on
the
way
of
these
we
told
him
and
there
did
seem
in
him
a
kind
of
joy
to
hear
of
it
they
are
about
the
court
and
as
think
they
have
already
order
this
night
to
play
before
him
tis
most
true
and
he
beseechd
me
to
entreat
your
majesties
to
hear
and
see
the
matter
with
all
my
heart
and
it
doth
much
content
me
to
hear
him
so
inclined
good
gentlemen
give
him
a
further
edge
and
drive
his
purpose
on
to
these
delights
we
shall
my
lord
exeunt
and
sweet
gertrude
leave
us
too
for
we
have
closely
sent
for
hamlet
hither
that
he
as
twere
by
accident
may
here
affront
ophelia
her
father
and
myself
lawful
espials
will
so
bestow
ourselves
that
seeing
unseen
we
may
of
their
encounter
frankly
judge
and
gather
by
him
as
he
is
behaved
if
t
be
the
affliction
of
his
love
or
no
that
thus
he
suffers
for
shall
obey
you
and
for
your
part
ophelia
do
wish
that
your
good
beauties
be
the
happy
cause
of
hamlets
wildness
so
shall
hope
your
virtues
will
bring
him
to
his
wonted
way
again
to
both
your
honours
madam
wish
it
may
exit
ophelia
walk
you
here
gracious
so
please
you
we
will
bestow
ourselves
to
read
on
this
book
that
show
of
such
an
exercise
may
colour
your
loneliness
we
are
oft
to
blame
in
this
tis
too
much
provedthat
with
devotions
visage
and
pious
action
we
do
sugar
oer
the
devil
himself
aside
tis
too
true
how
smart
a
lash
that
speech
doth
give
my
conscience
the
harlots
cheek
beautied
with
plastering
art
is
not
more
ugly
to
the
thing
that
helps
it
than
is
my
deed
to
my
most
painted
word
heavy
burthen
hear
him
coming
lets
withdraw
my
lord
exeunt
and
enter
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
whether
tis
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
or
to
take
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
and
by
opposing
end
them
to
die
to
sleep
no
more
and
by
a
sleep
to
say
we
end
the
heartache
and
the
thousand
natural
shocks
that
flesh
is
heir
to
tis
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wishd
to
die
to
sleep
to
sleep
perchance
to
dream
ay
theres
the
rub
for
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come
when
we
have
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
must
give
us
pause
theres
the
respect
that
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
for
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
the
oppressors
wrong
the
proud
mans
contumely
the
pangs
of
despised
love
the
laws
delay
the
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
that
patient
merit
of
the
unworthy
takes
when
he
himself
might
his
quietus
make
with
a
bare
bodkin
who
would
fardels
bear
to
grunt
and
sweat
under
a
weary
life
but
that
the
dread
of
something
after
death
the
undiscoverd
country
from
whose
bourn
no
traveller
returns
puzzles
the
will
and
makes
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
thus
conscience
does
make
cowards
of
us
all
and
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
is
sicklied
oer
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
and
enterprises
of
great
pith
and
moment
with
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
and
lose
the
name
of
actionsoft
you
now
the
fair
ophelia
nymph
in
thy
orisons
be
all
my
sins
rememberd
good
my
lord
how
does
your
honour
for
this
many
a
day
humbly
thank
you
well
well
well
my
lord
have
remembrances
of
yours
that
have
longed
long
to
redeliver
pray
you
now
receive
them
no
not
never
gave
you
aught
my
honourd
lord
you
know
right
well
you
did
and
with
them
words
of
so
sweet
breath
composed
as
made
the
things
more
rich
their
perfume
lost
take
these
again
for
to
the
noble
mind
rich
gifts
wax
poor
when
givers
prove
unkind
there
my
lord
ha
ha
are
you
honest
my
lord
are
you
fair
what
means
your
lordship
that
if
you
be
honest
and
fair
your
honesty
should
admit
no
discourse
to
your
beauty
could
beauty
my
lord
have
better
commerce
than
with
honesty
ay
truly
for
the
power
of
beauty
will
sooner
transform
honesty
from
what
it
is
to
a
bawd
than
the
force
of
honesty
can
translate
beauty
into
his
likeness
this
was
sometime
a
paradox
but
now
the
time
gives
it
proof
did
love
you
once
indeed
my
lord
you
made

on
brood
and
do
doubt
the

be
some
danger
which
for
to
prevent
have
in

thus
set

down
he
shall
with

haply

shall

puts

thus
from

what
think
you
ont
it
shall
do
well
but
yet
do
believe
the
origin
and
commencement
of
his
grief
sprung
from
neglected
love
how
now
ophelia
you
need
not
tell
us
what
lord
hamlet
said
we
heard
it
all
my
lord
do
as
you
please
but
if
you
hold
it
fit
after
the
play
let
his
queen
mother
all
alone
entreat
him
to
show
his
grief
let
her
be
round
with
him

ill
be
placed
so
please
you
in

all
their

if
she
find
him
not
to
england
send
him
or
confine
him
where
your
wisdom
best
shall
think
it
shall
be
so
madness
in
great
ones
must
not
unwatchd
go
exeunt
hall
in
the
castle
enter
and
players
speak
the
speech
pray
you
as
pronounced
it
to
you
trippingly
on
the
tongue
but
if
you
mouth
it
as
many
of
your
players
do
had
as
lief
the
towncrier
spoke
my
lines
nor
do
not
saw
the
air
too
much
with
your
hand
thus
but
use
all
gently
for
in
the
very
torrent
tempest
and
as
may
say
the
whirlwind
of
passion
you
must
acquire
and
beget
a
temperance
that
may
give
it
smoothness
it
offends
me
to
the
soul
to
hear
a
robustious
periwigpated
fellow
tear
a
passion
to
tatters
to
very
rags
to
split
the
ears
of
the
groundlings
who
for
the
most
part
are
capable
of
nothing
but
inexplicable
dumbshows
and
noise
would
have
such
a
fellow
whipped
for
oerdoing

it
outherods
herod
pray
you
avoid
it
first
player
warrant
your
honour
be
not
too
tame
neither
but
let
your
own
discretion
be
your

suit
the
action
to
the
word
the
word
to
the
action
with
this
special
observance
that
you
oerstep
not
the
modesty
of
nature
for
any
thing
so
overdone
is
from
the
purpose
of
playing
whose
end
both
at
the
first
and
now
was
and
is
to
hold
as
twere
the
mirror
up
to
nature
to
show
virtue
her
own
feature
scorn
her
own
image
and
the
very
age
and
body
of
the

his

pressure
now
this
overdone
or
come
tardy
off
though
it
make
the
unskilful
laugh
cannot
but
make
the
judicious
grieve
the
censure
of
the
which
one
must
in
your
allowance
oerweigh
a
whole
theatre
of
others
there
be
players
that
have
seen
play
and
heard
others
praise
and
that
highly
not
to
speak
it
profanely
that
neither
having
the
accent
of
christians
nor
the
gait
of
christian
pagan
nor
man
have
so
strutted
and
bellowed
that
have
thought
some
of
natures
journeymen
had
made
men
and
not
made
them
well
they
imitated
humanity
so
abominably
first
player
hope
we
have
reformed
that
indifferently
with
us
sir
reform
it
altogether
and
let
those
that
play
your
clowns
speak
no
more
than
is
set
down
for
them
for
there
be
of
them
that
will
themselves
laugh
to
set
on
some
quantity
of
barren
spectators
to
laugh
too
though
in
the
mean
time
some
necessary
question
of
the
play
be
then
to
be
considered
thats
villanous
and
shows
a
most
pitiful
ambition
in
the
fool
that
uses
it
go
make
you
ready
exeunt
players
enter
and
how
now
my
lord
will
the
king
hear
this
piece
of
work
and
the
queen
too
and
that
presently
bid
the
players
make
haste
exit
will
you
two
help
to
hasten
them
we
will
my

at

do
not

from
thee
that
no

no

to
your

sir

with
your

most
eloquent

you

you

mystery
you
would
sound
me
from
my
lowest

there
is
much

cannot
you
make

speak
sblood
do
you
think

though
you
can

yet
you
cannot

enter
god
bless
you
sir
my
lord
the

would
speak
with
you

presently
do
you
see
yonder
cloud
thats
almost
in
shape
of
a
camel
by
the
mass
and
tis
like
a
camel
indeed
methinks
it
is
like
a
weasel
it
is
backed
like
a
weasel
or
like
a
whale
very
like
a

tis
now
the
very
witching
time
of
night
when
churchyards
yawn
and
hell
itself
breathes
out
contagion
to
this
world
now
could
drink
hot
blood
and
do
such
bitter
business
as
the

would
quake
to
look
on
soft

to
my

the

the

huge

ten

each

petty

as
you
said
and
wisely
was
it
said
tis
meet
that
some
more
audience
than
a

nature
makes

partial
should
oerhear
the
speech
of
vantage
fare
you
well
my

ill
call
upon
you
ere
you

stand
in
pause

shall
first
begin
and
both
neglect

were
thicker

itself
with
brothers
blood
is
there
not
rain
enough
in
the
sweet
heavens
to
wash
it
white
as

whereto
serves
mercy
but
to
confront
the

of
offence
and
whats
in

but
this
twofold
force
to
be
forestalled
ere
we
come
to
fall
or
pardond
being
down
then
ill
look
up
my
fault
is
past
but
what
form
of
prayer
can
serve
my
turn
forgive
me
my
foul
murder
that
cannot
be
since

still
possessd
of
those

for
which
did
the
murder
my
crown
mine
own
ambition
and
my
queen
may
one
be
pardond

retain
the
offence
in
the
corrupted
currents
of
this
world
offences
gilded

shove

justice
and
oft
tis

the

buys
out

law
but
tis
not
so
above
there
is
no
shuffling
there
the
action
lies
in
his
true
nature
and
we
ourselves
compelld
even
to
the
teeth
and
forehead
of
our
faults

my

grossly
full

am
then
revenged
to
take
him

of
his
soul

rage

in
the
incestuous
pleasure
of
his
bed
at
gaming
swearing
or
about
some
act
that
has
no
relish
of
salvation
int
then
trip
him
that
his
heels
may
kick
at
heaven
and
that
his
soul
may
be
as
damnd
and
black
as
hell
whereto
it
goes
my

look
here
upon
this

on
this
the
counterfeit
presentment
of
two
brothers

what
a
grace
was
seated
on
this
brow
hyperions
curls
the
front
of
jove
himself
an
eye
like

a
form
indeed
where
every
god
did
seem
to
set
his
seal
to
give
the
world
assurance
of
a
man
this
was
your
husband
look
you
now
what
follows
here
is
your
husband
like
a
mildewd
ear
blasting
his
wholesome
brother

you

you
on
this
fair
mountain
leave

on
this
moor
ha
have
you
eyes
you
cannot
call
it
love
for
at
your
age
the
heyday
in
the
blood
is
tame
its
humble
and
waits
upon
the
judgment
and
what
judgment
would
step
from
this
to
this
sense
sure
you
have
else
could
you
not
have
motion
but
sure
that
sense
is
apoplexd
for
madness
would
not
err
nor
sense
to
ecstasy
was
neer
so
thralld
but
it
reserved
some
quantity
of
choice
to
serve
in
such
a
difference
what
devil
wast
that
thus

thy
blush
rebellious
hell
if
thou

youth
let

be

proclaim
no

when
the

this
my

the
next
more

almost
can
change
the

either
curb
the
devil
or
throw
him
out
with
wondrous
potency
once
more
good
night
and
when
you
are
desirous
to
be
blessd
ill
blessing
beg
of
you
for
this
same
lord
pointing
to
do

heaven
hath
pleased
it
so
to
punish
me
with
this
and
this
with
me
that
must
be
their
scourge
and
minister
will
bestow
him
and
will
answer
well
the
death
gave
him
so
again
good
night
must
be
cruel
only
to

as
the
sea
and
wind
when
both
contend
which
is
the
mightier
in

lawless
fit
behind

arras
hearing
something
stir
whips
out

disease
to
keep
it
from
divulging
let
it
feed
even

hath
killd

some

letters
for
him
ere
we
were
two
days
old
at
sea
a
pirate
of
very
warlike
appointment
gave
us
chase
finding
ourselves
too
slow
of
sail
we
put
on
a
compelled
valour
and
in
the
grapple
boarded
them
on
the
instant
they
got
clear
of
our
ship
so
alone
became
their
prisoner
they
have
dealt
with
me
like
thieves
of

they
knew
what
they
did

to

a

words
to
speak
in
thine
ear
will
make
thee
dumb
yet
are
they
much
too
light
for
the
bore
of
the

good
fellows

that
thou

you

for
these
your

and
dot
the

that
you
may

me
to
him
from
whom
you
brought
them
exeunt
another
room
in
the
castle
enter
and
now
must
your
conscience
my
acquaintance
seal
and
you
must
put
me
in
your
heart
for
friend
sith
you
have
heard
and
with
a
knowing
ear
that
he
which
hath
your
noble
father
slain
pursued
my
life
it
well
appears
but
tell
me
why
you
proceeded
not
against
these
feats
so
crimeful
and
so
capital
in
nature
as
by
your
safety
wisdom
all
things
else
you
mainly
were
stirrd
up
for
two
special
reasons
which
may
to
you
perhaps
seem
much
unsinewd
but
yet
to
me
they
are
strong
the
queen
his
mother
lives
almost
by
his
looks
and
for
myself
my
virtue
or
my
plague
be
it
either
which
shes
so
conjunctive
to
my
life
and
soul
that
as
the
star
moves
not
but
in
his
sphere
could
not
but
by
her
the
other
motive
why
to
a
public
count
might
not
go
is
the
great
love
the
general
gender
bear
him
who
dipping
all
his
faults
in
their
affection
would
like
the
spring
that
turneth
wood
to
stone
convert
his
gyves
to
graces
so
that
my
arrows
too
slightly
timberd
for
so
loud
a
wind
would
have
reverted
to
my
bow
again
and
not
where
had
aimd
them
and
so
have
a
noble
father
lost
sister
driven
into
desperate
terms
whose
worth
if
praises
may
go
back
again
stood
challenger
on
mount
of
all
the
age
for
her
perfections
but
my
revenge
will
come
break
not
your
sleeps
for
that
you
must
not
think
that
we
are
made
of
stuff
so
flat
and
dull
that
we
can
let
our
beard
be
shook
with
danger
and
think
it
pastime
you
shortly
shall
hear
more
loved
your
father
and
we
love
ourself
and
that
hope
will
teach
you
to
imagine

strange
return

sickness

to
his
teeth
thus
didest
thou

how

how
otherwise

ay
my
lord
so
you
will
not
oerrule

a
peace
to
thine

peace

he
be

returnd
as
checking
at
his
voyage
and
that
he
means
no
more
to
undertake
it
will
work
him
to
an
exploit
now
ripe
in
my
device
under
the
which
he
shall
not
choose
but
fall
and
for
his
death
no
wind
of
blame
shall
breathe
but
even
his
mother
shall
uncharge
the
practise
and
call
it
accident
my
lord
will
be
ruled
the
rather
if
you
could
devise
it
so
that
might
be
the
organ
it
falls
right
you
have
been
talkd
of
since
your
travel
much
and
that
in
hamlets
hearing
for
a
quality
wherein
they
say
you
shine
your
sum
of
parts
did
not
together
pluck
such
envy
from
him
as
did
that
one
and
that
in
my
regard
of
the
unworthiest
siege
what
part
is
that
my
lord
very
riband
in
the
cap
of
youth
yet
needful
too
for
youth
no
less
becomes
the
light
and
careless
livery
that
it
wears
than
settled
age
his
sables
and
his
weeds
importing
health
and
graveness
two
months
since
here
was
a
gentleman
of
normandy
ive
seen
myself
and
served
against
the
french
and
they
can
well
on
horseback
but
this
gallant
had
witchcraft
int
he
grew
unto
his
seat
and
to
such
wondrous
doing
brought
his
horse
as
he
had
been
incorpsed
and
deminatured
with
the
brave
beast
so
far
he
toppd
my
thought
that
in
forgery
of
shapes
and
tricks
come
short
of
what
he
did
norman
wast
norman
upon
my
life
lamond
the
very
same
know
him
well
he
is
the
brooch
indeed
and
gem
of
all
the
nation
he
made
confession
of
you
and
gave
you
such
a
masterly
report
for
art
and
exercise
in
your
defence
and
for
your
rapier
most
especially
that
he
cried
out
twould
be
a
sight
indeed
if
one
could
match
you
the
scrimers
of
their
nation
he
swore
had
had
neither
motion
guard
nor
eye
if
you
opposed
them
sir
this
report
of
his
did
hamlet
so
envenom
with
his
envy
that
he
could
nothing
do
but
wish
and
beg
your
sudden
coming
oer
to
play
with
him
now
out
of
this
what
out
of
this
my
lord
laertes
was
your
father
dear
to
you
or
are
you
like
the
painting
of
a
sorrow
face
without
a
heart
why
ask
you
this
not
that
think
you
did
not
love
your
father
but
that
know
love
is
begun
by
time
and
that
see
in
passages
of
proof
time
qualifies
the
spark
and
fire
of
it
there
lives
within
the
very
flame
of
love
kind
of
wick
or
snuff
that
will
abate
it
and
nothing
is
at
a
like
goodness
still
for
goodness
growing
to
a
plurisy
dies
in
his
own
too
much
that
we
would
do
we
should
do
when
we
would
for
this
would
changes
and
hath
abatements
and
delays
as
many
as
there
are
tongues
are
hands
are
accidents
and
then
this
should
is
like
a
spendthrift
sigh
that
hurts
by
easing
but
to
the
quick
o
the
ulcer
hamlet
comes
back
what
would
you
undertake
to
show
yourself
your
fathers
son
in
deed
more
than
in
words
to
cut
his
throat
i
the
church
no
place
indeed
should
murder
sanctuarize
revenge
should
have
no
bounds
but
good
laertes
will
you
do
this
keep
close
within
your
chamber
hamlet
returnd
shall
know
you
are
come
home
well
put
on
those
shall
praise
your
excellence
and
set
a
double
varnish
on
the
fame
the
frenchman
gave
you
bring
you
in
fine
together
and
wager
on
your
heads
he
being
remiss
most
generous
and
free
from
all
contriving
will
not
peruse
the
foils
so
that
with
ease
or
with
a
little
shuffling
you
may
choose
sword
unbated
and
in
a
pass
of
practise
requite
him
for
your
father
will
dot
and
for
that
purpose
ill
anoint
my
sword
bought
an
unction
of
a
mountebank
so
mortal
that
but
dip
a
knife
in
it
where
it
draws
blood
no
cataplasm
so
rare
collected
from
all
simples
that
have
virtue
under
the
moon
can
save
the
thing
from
death
that
is
but
scratchd
withal
ill
touch
my
point
with
this
contagion
that
if
gall
him
slightly
it
may
be
death
lets
further
think
of
this
weigh
what
convenience
both
of
time
and
means
may
fit
us
to
our
shape
if
this
should
fail
and
that
our
drift
look
through
our
bad
performance
twere
better
not
assayd
therefore
this
project
should
have
a
back
or
second
that
might
hold
if
this
should
blast
in
proof
soft
let
me
see
well
make
a
solemn
wager
on
your
cunnings
hat
when
in
your
motion
you
are
hot
and
dry
as
make
your
bouts
more
violent
to
that
end
and
that
he
calls
for
drink
ill
have
prepared
him
chalice
for
the
nonce
whereon
but
sipping
if
he
by
chance
escape
your
venomd
stuck
our
purpose
may
hold
there
enter
how
now
sweet
queen
one
woe
doth
tread
upon
anothers
heel
so
fast
they
follow
your
sisters
drownd
laertes
drownd
where
there
is
a
willow
grows
aslant
a
brook
that
shows
his
hoar
leaves
in
the
glassy
stream
there
with
fantastic
garlands
did
she
come
of
crowflowers
nettles
daisies
and
long
purples
that
liberal
shepherds
give
a
grosser
name
but
our
cold
maids
do
dead
mens
fingers
call
them
there
on
the
pendent
boughs
her
coronet
weeds
clambering
to
hang
an
envious
sliver
broke
when
down
her
weedy
trophies
and
herself
fell
in
the
weeping
brook
her
clothes
spread
wide
and
mermaidlike
awhile
they
bore
her
up
which
time
she
chanted
snatches
of
old
tunes
as
one
incapable
of
her
own
distress
or
like
a
creature
native
and
indued
unto
that
element
but
long
it
could
not
be
till
that
her
garments
heavy
with
their
drink
pulld
the
poor
wretch
from
her
melodious
lay
to
muddy
death
alas
then
she
is
drownd
drownd
drownd
too
much
of
water
hast
thou
poor
ophelia
and
therefore
forbid
my
tears
but
yet
it
is
our
trick
nature
her

bold
my
fears
forgetting

the
effect
of
what
wrote
ay
good
my
lord
an
earnest
conjuration
from
the
king
as
england
was
his
faithful
tributary
as
love
between
them
like
the
palm
might
flourish
as
peace
should
stiff
her
wheaten
garland
wear
and
stand
a
comma

their
amities

their
defeat

by
their

at
leisure
should
impart
a

is
indifferent
cold
my
lord
indeed
but
yet
methinks
it
is
very
sultry
and
hot
for
my
complexion
exceedingly
my
lord
it
is
very
sultryas
twerei
cannot
tell
how
but
my

laid
a
great
wager
on
your

is
the
matter
beseech
you

in
good
faith
sir
here
is
newly
come
to
court
laertes
believe
me
an
absolute
gentleman
full
of
most
excellent
differences
of
very
soft
society
and
great
showing
indeed
to
speak
feelingly
of
him
he
is
the
card
or
calendar
of
gentry
for
you
shall
find
in
him
the
continent
of
what
part
a
gentleman
would
see
sir
his
definement
suffers
no
perdition
in
you
though
know
to
divide
him
inventorially
would
dizzy
the
arithmetic
of
memory
and
yet
but
yaw
neither
in
respect
of
his
quick
sail
but
in
the
verity
of
extolment
take
him
to
be
a
soul
of
great
article
and
his
infusion
of
such
dearth
and
rareness
as
to
make
true
diction
of
him
his
semblable
is
his
mirror
and
who
else
would
trace
him
his
umbrage
nothing
more
your
lordship
speaks
most
infallibly
of
him
the
concernancy
sir
why
do
we
wrap
the
gentleman
in
our
more
rawer
breath
sir
ist
not
possible
to
understand
in
another
tongue
you
will
dot
sir
really
what
imports
the
nomination
of
this
gentleman
of
laertes
his
purse
is
empty
already
alls
golden
words
are
spent
of
him
sir
know
you
are
not
ignorant
would
you
did
sir
yet
in
faith
if
you
did
it
would
not
much
approve
me
well
sir
you
are
not
ignorant
of
what
excellence
laertes
is
dare
not
confess
that
lest
should
compare
with
him
in
excellence
but
to
know
a
man
well
were
to
know
himself
mean
sir
for
his
weapon
but
in
the
imputation
laid
on
him
by
them
in
his
meed
hes
unfellowed
whats
his
weapon
rapier
and
dagger
thats
two
of
his
weapons
but
well
the
king
sir
hath
wagered
with
him
six
barbary
horses
against
the
which
he
has
imponed
as
take
it
six
french
rapiers
and
poniards
with
their
assigns
as
girdle
hangers
and
so
three
of
the
carriages
in
faith
are
very
dear
to
fancy
very
responsive
to
the
hilts
most
delicate
carriages
and
of
very
liberal
conceit
what
call
you
the
carriages
knew
you
must
be
edified
by
the
margent
ere
you
had
done
the
carriages
sir
are
the
hangers
the
phrase
would
be
more
german
to
the
matter
if
we
could
carry
cannon
by
our
sides
would
it
might
be
hangers
till
then
but
on
six
barbary
horses
against
six
french
swords
their
assigns
and
three
liberalconceited
carriages
thats
the
french
bet
against
the
danish
why
is

shall
not
exceed
you
three
hits
he
hath
laid
on
twelve
for
nine

it
would
come
to
immediate
trial
if
your
lordship
would
vouchsafe
the
answer
how
if

opposition

it

no
matter
nay
good
my
lord
it
is
but
foolery
but
it

such
a
kind
of
gaingiving
as

perhaps
trouble
a
woman
if
your
mind
dislike
any
thing
obey
it
will
forestall
their
repair
hither

if

be
not
now
yet
it

march
afar
off

good

sweet

and
flights
of
angels
sing
thee
to
thy
rest
why
does
the
drum
come
hither
march
within
enter
the
english
ambassadors
and
others
where
is
this
sight
what
is
it
ye
would
see
if
aught
of
woe
or
wonder
cease
your
search
this
quarry
cries
on
havoc
proud
death
what
feast
is
toward
in
thine
eternal
cell
that
thou
so
many
princes
at
a
shot
so
bloodily
hast
struck
first
ambassador
the
sight
is
dismal
and
our
affairs
from
england
come
too
late
the
ears
are
senseless
that
should
give
us
hearing
to
tell
him
his
commandment
is
fulfilld
that
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
are
dead
where
should
we
have
our
thanks
not
from
his
mouth
had
it
the
ability
of
life
to
thank
you
he
never
gave
commandment
for
their
death
but
since
so
jump
upon
this
bloody
question
you
from
the
polack
wars
and
you
from
england
are
here
arrived
give
order
that
these
bodies
high
on
a
stage
be
placed
to
the
view
and
let
me
speak
to
the
yet
unknowing
world
how
these
things
came
about
so
shall
you
hear
of
carnal
bloody
and
unnatural
acts
of
accidental
judgments
casual
slaughters
of
deaths
put
on
by
cunning
and
forced
cause
and
in
this
upshot
purposes
mistook
falln
on
the
inventors
reads
all
this
can
truly
deliver
let
us
haste
to
hear
it
and
call
the
noblest
to
the
audience
for
me
with
sorrow
embrace
my
fortune
have
some
rights
of
memory
in
this
kingdom
which
now
to
claim
my
vantage
doth
invite
me
of
that
shall
have
also
cause
to
speak
and
from
his
mouth
whose
voice
will
draw
on
more
but
let
this
same
be
presently
performd
even
while
mens
minds
are
wild
lest
more
mischance
on
plots
and
errors
happen
let
four
captains
bear
hamlet
like
a
soldier
to
the
stage
for
he
was
likely
had
he
been
put
on
to
have
proved
most
royally
and
for
his
passage
the
soldiers
music
and
the
rites
of
war
speak
loudly
for
him
take
up
the
bodies
such
a
sight
as
this
becomes
the
field
but
here
shows
much
amiss
go
bid
the
soldiers
shoot
dead
march
exeunt
bearing
off
the
dead
bodies
after
which
a
peal
of
ordnance
is
shot
off
