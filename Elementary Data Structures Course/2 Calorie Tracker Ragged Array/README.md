<h2>Objective:</h2> The goal of this assignment is to practice two-dimensional and
ragged arrays.

<h2>Calories 1:</h2> The client will provide data in the form of a text file.
Each line will contain three numbers separated by spaces. The numbers
represent the number of calories consumed for breakfast, lunch and dinner,
respectively. Your program should read the data from the file into a 2-dimensional
array of size 7×3, where each row will keep record of calories consumed for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Then, compute and print out the following
information:<br>
• a list of the total number of calories consumed each day from Monday to
Sunday<br>
• the average number of calories consumed each day<br>
• the average number of calories (average over the week) consumed in
each of the three meals<br>
• the maximum number of calories consumed each day<br>
• the maximum number of calories consumed in each meal type<br>
Your program must have separate methods for reading in the data and for
printing each of the different quantities given above.

<h2>Calories 2:</h2> The client comes back and would like you to make the
program more general, so that it can handle any number of meals in any of the
days of a week. That is, you no longer know that there will be exactly three
columns in the data; however, the number of lines is still seven. Change the implementation to use the concept
of 2-dimensional Ragged Array that we discussed in the class. The client is
interested in the following information now.<br>
• the average number of calories consumed each day<br>
• the average number of calories consumed in every meal of the week. For
