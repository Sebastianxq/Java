<h2>What is contained in this directory?</h2>
Within this directory are labs from the "Elementary Data Structures & Algorithms" Course at UTEP otherwise known as <b>CS2</b>, <b>Programming Principles 2</b> or anything alonge those lines

<h2>What is the purpose of the files in this directory?</h2>
The files within this directory were all part of prompts assigned to me when I took CS2 and are meant as references for myself and anyone else who may come upon my github.

<h2>How can I learn more about the prompts for the labs?</h2>
The READMEs within each directory will have the prompt for the labs. 

<h2>What do the numbers at the beginning of the directories mean?</h2>
Those numbers symbolize the order than the labs were given to me. 1 of course being the first lab that was assigned, leading all the way up to 10. I chose to do that in this directory in order to make it appear more structures as in my opinion the remnant files that i have from the course are not as well documented as the ones that I had for Data Structures.

<h2>Some of the files don't compile correctly, why is that?</h2>
This may be caused by a name mismatch when i initially stored these files, ensure that the class name and the file name match correctly.
