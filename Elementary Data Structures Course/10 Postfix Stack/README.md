<h2>Objective:</h2> The goal of this assignment is to practice implementing stacks.

<h2>Background:</h2> A mathematician hires you to write a program that can compute some expressions
written in postfix form.

<h2>Assignment:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write a generic class for a stack using a linked list. The generic stack class must have the
name GenericStack. You must write regular stack methods (e.g., createStack, isEmpty,
push, pop, popAll, peek) in the GenericStack class. Stack content must be of Object
type (that is, the stack can store any data type). Create any other class necessary for the linked
  list. </li>
<li>Write a class named Evaluator. The Evaluator class is the only class that will contain
the main method. The Evaluator class will prompt for an input file and read the file line
by line. Each line of the file will contain a postfix expression as an input. In the lecture
sessions, we have seen how we can compute a postfix expression using a stack. Use a
GenericStack object to compute the value of each expression your program will read
from the input file. The actual evaluation must be done in the Evaluator class.
GenericStack is the data structure that will be used to evaluate an expression. Report the
result for each expression on the terminal. Some expressions may be incomplete; report an
  error for those expressions. </li>
