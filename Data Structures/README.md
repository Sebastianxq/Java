<h2>What is contained in this directory?</h2>
Each of the directories contains a lab that was assigned to me during the data structures course taught at UTEP. 

<h2>How do I find out the purpose of each lab?</h2>
The README within each directory contains a explanation of the lab's prompt, my proposed solution, an analysis of the outcome 
and my conclusion of the experience. 

<h2>The labs do not compile when I download them, why?</h2>
When archiving the labs on my computer, I changed the file names to something that would make more sense to me. 
This will require you to either change the filenames or change the class names within the program?

<h2>Do I need any external APIs or libraries to run these labs?</h2>
Yes and no, the Edit Distance lab will require libraries that may not exist within your computer.  
Besides that, all the other labs should include all the files needed to run them effectively
